## JTE with Java Classes 2: ArrayList Answer
---
### Description
In this lab we will cover how to iterate through an ArrayList of Java Objects using JTE.

---
### Steps

1. In src -> main -> java -> objects, add your fields and getters to your SeaCreature.java file. Make sure to have at least 3 fields, getters and a constructor in this file. 
2. In src -> main -> java -> Main.java, create an ArrayList of SeaCreature objects. Add at least 4 SeaCreature objects to your list.
3. In the same file, create a new route and handler for your list of SeaCreature objects.
4. In src -> main -> jte, add your implementation in the seaCreatures.jte file where you will iterate through your list with a for loop. Make sure to add the imports and parameters required. Add your for loop inside the body tag.
